# go-intersect

  Find the intersection of two iterable values.

  This library provides multiple implementations which each have their strong and weak points.

## Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/juliangruber/go-intersect
```

## Example

```go
import "github.com/juliangruber/go-intersect"
import "fmt"

func main() {
  a := []int{1, 2, 3}
  b := []int{2, 3, 4}
  fmt.Println(intersect.SimpleGeneric(a, b))
}
```

## Generics

Go v1.18 now supports generics which increases performance compared to reflection. Below are benchmark results between reflection and generics of the hash intersection functions. Slice sizes of 1, 10, 100 1.000 and 10.000 are used.

The average time and allocated bytes are more than halved when using generics, and the number of times bytes have to be allocated from the heap are improved significantly.
